This is my solution to HW5.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

``` r
library(rvest)
```

    ## Loading required package: xml2

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'rvest'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     pluck

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:readr':
    ## 
    ##     guess_encoding

``` r

library(data.table)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'data.table'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     between, first, last

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:purrr':
    ## 
    ##     transpose

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.color = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_color_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

Read in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
   city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
   resolved = case_when(
     disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
     disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
     disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
   ) 
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate …..

``` r
results_df = 
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_test) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_test) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) 
```

## Problem 2

Import the 20 files, clean, and tidy.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("./lddata")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lddata/", path),
    path_names = path,
    data = map(path, read_csv)
    ) %>% 
  separate(col = path_names, into = c("path_1", "path_2"), sep = 7, remove = T) %>% 
  separate(col = path_2, into = c("arm", "ID"), sep = 3) %>% 
  separate(col = ID, into = c("underscore", "ID"), sep = 1, remove = T) %>% 
  separate(col = ID, into = c("ID", "csv"), sep = 2, remove = T) %>% 
  select(-path_1, -underscore, -csv) %>% 
  mutate(
    arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "Control"),
    arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "Experiment")) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "observation"
  ) 
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations

``` r
path_plot = 
  path_df %>% 
  unite("Arm_ID", arm:ID, sep = "_", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = Arm_ID, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Observations per Subject Over Time")

path_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_aw3251_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot shows that overall, the observations for the subjects in the
experiment group were higher than the observations for the control
group. Though the starting observations for the subjects were mixed at
week 1, all observations for the experiment group were higher than all
observations for the control group at week 8.

## Problem 3

simulate sample from normal distribution of 30 w sd of 5. change mean
from 0 to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. for each mean, generate 5000 datasets. Not
exporting mean and sd - exporting the results of the ttest of whether
the mean = 0. reject or fail to reject 5% of time, etc. point: see what
happens as you move from 0 to 5. make plot of estimated mean when true
mean is 0-5, filter for when p \<0.05 and then compute mean. start with
simmean and sd function we wrote in class and modify. plots are
summaries of that p values and estimates based on whether thigns are
significant. always testing null hyp that mean = 0.

``` r
sim_ttest = function(n, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
    ttest=t.test(sim_data, mu=0, sd=5)
    ttest[['p.value']]
    ttest[['estimate']]
    
  sim_results = tibble(
     pvalue = ttest[['p.value']],
     mean = ttest[['estimate']]
  )

}

output = vector("list", 100)

for (i in 1:100) {
  output[[i]] = sim_ttest(30)
}
sim_results = bind_rows(output)
```

``` r
sim_results1 = 
  rerun(5000, )
```
